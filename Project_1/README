Had to implement a website akin to Wiki where users can see and edit data

Challenges:
1. Getting used to Django's format. Started this project with no idea what to do and slowly by slowly by rewatching the lecture 3 times, 
reading documentation, and googling did I finally manage to parse what to do

2. Struggled most with implementing the 'create page' function. Mostly due to unfamiliarity with how all the sections work in django. Finishing that section
brought out GREAT emotion
